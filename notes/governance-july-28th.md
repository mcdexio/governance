Jean Miao - Before we officially start, please note that: Since we haven‚Äôt enabled on-chain voting yet, the goal of this meeting is to consult the community about the topics in the proposal. After meeting, the team will announce results based on the discussion. For on-chain voting, the team is working on it and will be live soon. Stay tuned!

# Team Decisions
### Topic 1: Liquidity Mining Round SHANG
1. **Round SHANG lasts for 2 weeks, starting from Block: 10,625,000 to Block 10,727,499, right after the current Round XIA.** 
The 4-week period seems to be more stable and predictable, but MCDEX is still in the early stage, we value flexibility more than stability. And we hope to get feedback and move fast. If everything goes well, we can still keep the same rule for the next round. We‚Äôve made some huge changes and will see how it goes. So as an experiment, we prefer to have it short and flexible.


2. **2 MCB / Block, Total supply for Round SHANG: 205,000 MCB**
The MCB for user incentive is up to 5% per year, which is around 2 MCB / Block.
2 MCB / Block already meets the up limit of it. So for now, let‚Äôs keep it to 2 for now.


3. **Incentivize MCB liquidity providers on Uniswap, MCB/ETH pair. 0.5 MCB / Block will be rewarded to LPs on Uniswap**
Both Uniswap and Balancer have a good side as a MCB pool. Take into account that the Uniswap already has some liquidity and the relatively popular, we will choose uniswap to incentivize in the next round. 25%, which is 0.5, of the total MCB will go to LPs on Uniswap.


4. **No vesting for round SHANG.**
Since there is a huge debate on whether we should have vesting for LPs and we don‚Äôt want to have a big move, we decided to hold the vesting plan. We can see how this experiment goes and decide later.


5. **Imbalance threshold for 100% mining efficiency will increase to 20%**


### Topic 2: eUSD
eUSD - a synthetic asset minted by tokenizing the perpetual positions, will be live in August, audited by PwC, Former Chainsecurity. When live, we will incentivize liquidity providers on Curve.

### Topic 3: Increase the trading fee on order book
The New Trading Fee Structure for Order Book will be effective from UTC 2pm, July 29th, 2020

- Min order size: $1000
- Maker fee = 0%
- Taker fee = 1% when order size < $12,000
- Taker fee = 0.15% when order size >=  $12,000

# Agenda
### Topic 1: Liquidity Mining Round SHANG
(1) **How long should the next round Shang last? Two weeks or four weeks?**

DAOking - I also think 4 weeks is best. Too many changes too often are bad. Slow and steady. 1 month seems flexible enough. 2 weeks will freak people out. People DONT want to be part of governance they want to use something with reasonable expectations that it will work as intended... for 2 weeks is too short... 1 month is short but reasonable. This is a big ship, that will get bigger quickly. We need slow and steady changes. A big ship should not turn on a dime. The bigger the ship TVL the more slow changes should be.

john_mc - 4 weeks is better

0xNick - My vote would be 2 weeks, quicker to adjust if needed. 4 weeks is hardly predictable or concrete; so a 2-week window allows us to make decisions as conditions change in what is a very nascent project. Agree that we need to work towards concrete, but IMO that's not something we should rush towards.

Dalvinchi - I think 4 weeks. Less sell pressure. More time for more people to participate. More time for the word to be spread about MCB mining, more awareness, etc

DAOking - More justification, please? Blockchain is not supposed to be flexible we want to come up with hard plans and stick with them, not regular changes. This scares people. Predictable is IMPORTANT

Petrus - 4 weeks

Quixote - 4 weeks is fine, it's what is done in the timeframe rather the timeframe itself. I think 2 weeks encourage transient liquidity.

CHICKPEAS - I‚Äôd definitely go with 4 weeks. DAOking had a fair point about slow and steady

leozing - yeah, we need to be flexible (in support of 4 weeks)

TÃ¥ÃïuÕú“âr“âÃ¢bÕ†oÃßÕ¢ÕÄ ÕûÃ¥BÃ¢“âaÕüÕÅmbÃïÃïoÃ®o - I'm with @Dalvinchi more time to participate and gain traction with new users, fewer changes less frequently.  Not everyone is able to be mega-engaged all the time, and we'll attract more users with a more consistent rule/rewards set.

Enzo - it is still early stage for MCDEX, flexibility is more needed than steadiness (in support of 2 weeks)

(2) **How many MCB per block? 2, more than 2, or less than 2?**

**In support of 2 MCB per block**

arata, ÊôöÁîò‰æØsiri, Petrus, Quixote - 2 MCB/block

TÃ¥ÃïuÕú“âr“âÃ¢bÕ†oÃßÕ¢ÕÄ ÕûÃ¥BÃ¢“âaÕüÕÅmbÃïÃïoÃ®o - unless an increase in that number is going to go to reward smaller LP's (specifically) (in some way) - it should remain at 2

CHICKPEAS - 2 per block is reasonable not need to change it

leozing - There is no point in changing the emission rate.

Quixote - no point in changing 2 per block for now

CoastalDegen - 2 should be the max. if you double you're gonna f..k yourselves next 6 months 100%. Maybe a better metric would be to consider adjusting the annual inflation rate? say down to 5 to 3%. You guys are a vastly over-inflated shitcoin to most of the market lol. Inflation really matters here. If you cant manage inflation for the project you cant manage long term value accrual. I‚Äôd suggest a discussion around lowering inflation rate alongside this IMO.

**In support of more than 2 MCB per block**

DAOking - We need to gain traction and attention, larger payout grabs many more users, many more providers. It's a type of user acquisition/ marketing. I think it should probably be front-loaded heavier. Start high and reduce. 

DAOking - No one thinks this should be utilized to capture attention?
- TÃ¥ÃïuÕú“âr“âÃ¢bÕ†oÃßÕ¢ÕÄ ÕûÃ¥BÃ¢“âaÕüÕÅmbÃïÃïoÃ®o - It requires some thought if it's increased in how it will be paid out, IMO.  If people want >2 per block I think it behooves the network to place the additional rewards outside of the largest LPs. I understand this is difficult to figure out where LP's don't split up between wallets, but there were some good suggestions on the forum on how to do that (mine and others)

DAOking - I think maybe a time-weighted payout would be smart! If you participated continuously, maybe for x amount of blocks you get a greater share... or some variation of this. If you are still mining from the previous round you get √ó% more than new miners. Keep base payout the same but change incentives slightly. 
- TÃ¥ÃïuÕú“âr“âÃ¢bÕ†oÃßÕ¢ÕÄ ÕûÃ¥BÃ¢“âaÕüÕÅmbÃïÃïoÃ®o - ah I feel like those questions are interlinked personally - but if it's only on the amount. I'd say 3 (b/c I want the extra 1 to go to smaller LP's). I like that idea DAOKing.
- Vikas | MCDEX - Definitely, agree with @DAOking
- Gareth | MCDEX - I like this idea from @DAOking
- ÊôöÁîò‰æØsiri - Definitely, agree with @DAOking
- CoastalDegen - This is great. This would have incentivized me to keep in more eth this week.
- TÃ¥ÃïuÕú“âr“âÃ¢bÕ†oÃßÕ¢ÕÄ ÕûÃ¥BÃ¢“âaÕüÕÅmbÃïÃïoÃ®o - which is a good point, governance token initial distribution is important
- Fab√ò - agreed we need to find a mechanism to help people earned but also to lock the tokens as much as possible maybe a stacking mechanism like the one used by AMPL could help. An incentive to lock and stake for 90days.
- SNX for example decreases inflation yearly

DAOking - This also helps offset whales getting all of governance, or maybe we can encourage this somehow

DAOking - We need to be competitive, if we go slow now on incentives we may lose the race, or need to speed up later. Going slightly faster may help us get a head start on others.
- CoastalDegen - but also DAOKING too fast and you kill value
	- AJBlock - agreed, it would cause too much inflation
- Quixote - assuming though there is a thought process already implemented EG 5% per year

Vikas | MCDEX - 2 MCB/block to 4 MCB/block linearly increasing from Day 1 Week 1 to Day 7 Week 4 (1 month approx). As TVL will increase (competition increases).
- CoastalDegen - you also vastly increase free float and dilution. You're going to nuke value to miners frankly.
- DAOking - What about the opposite of this? 4 downwards to 1
	- Vikas | MCDEX - With increasing TVL - reward per ETH locked in the pool will reduce - if we reduce the MCB per block, it means - more reduction in reward.
- Quixote - increasing for the sake of competing on TVL is short-sighted IMO
- CoastalDegen - TLV without a moat is a literal meme

DAOking - Incentiviing early participants
- AJBlock - this is what all projects do actually, even bitcoin mining rewards have had halvings, the only issue i see with this is excessive inflation if early LP can get extra benefits but we find a way they don't dump on the market and increase inflation it would make sense

DAOking - We cannot forget there are also race conditions. Everyone else is starting to try to do the liquidity thing right now. 
- leozing - Depends on how the token accuses value.> We cannot forget there are also race conditions. Everyone else is starting to try to do the liquidity thing right now

(3) **Incentivize the MCB liquidity Provider**

(3.1) **Uniswap or Balancer**

**For Balancer**

leozing - Balancer. With balancer, we get bal tokens too.

TÃ¥ÃïuÕú“âr“âÃ¢bÕ†oÃßÕ¢ÕÄ ÕûÃ¥BÃ¢“âaÕüÕÅmbÃïÃïoÃ®o - I think ppl have won me over to Balancer

Dalvinchi - Balancer tends to be cheaper for gas in my experience

Rune20ü•Ç - Balancer - fees can be customized, weights can be customized. Plus extra incentive for BAL tokens if whitelisted. 
- john_mc - But we can only choose one of pool
- CoastelDegen - you can do 2 pools lol. 80/20 pools are nice for BAL
- Quixote - but that pool could be 33/33/33. or another weight.

Quixote - Balancer, and incentivize the staking of the BPT tokens somewhere else via MCDEX protocol
- CoastalDegen - yes

Quixote - Balancer attracts the sort of demographic who will use MCDEX. Uniswap attracts a much less sophisticated demographic IMO
- CoastalDegen - i agreee

CoastalDegen - with more technical understanding, MCB needs to sell itself to degen farmers atm. people who get defi will get why they wanna use this product. uniswap bois won‚Äôt.

CHICKPEAS - Yea I think balancer has more mature users.. uniswap is too crowded with clueless people.

**For Uniswap**

john_mc - I suggest uniswap. first, at present, the mcb main liquidity is in uniswap; second, the Uniswap pool has a high brand and market recognition. in addition, uniswap maybe has a token incentive plan, worth looking forward to it. I have seen some community members suggest incentivize balancer liquidity providers, So I did some data research: The total value of USD in balancer is 254m (from defiplus data), and the daily amount of BAL released by mining is 20714. After considering the liquidity incentive, even if the MCB pool is 10 times larger than the current size, The daily income BAL is about 2445 USD. I think Uniswap is a good advertising platform.

DAOking - Uniswap is more commonly used among new people. Its been around longer fewer risks.

Á•ûÁÅØ - I recommend choosing uniswap because uniswap has the greatest liquidity. Uniswap will also launch liquidity mining later. The current liquidity of uniswap is 6 times that of bal. We should keep the market as stable as possible. Bal currently locks a lot of tvl, just because they have opened liquidity mining. From market influence and market stability, I suggest choosing uniswap, and uniswap will also open liquidity mining rewards, uniswap is the preferred platform of defi, you can refer to  The success of the next amplifier. 

sveer - Uniswap is hot fav now for everyone. Prefer uniswap and if it doesn‚Äôt work out then go to BAL

0xNick - Preference is Uni. Uniswap tried and tested platform, the people love it.

Rune20ü•Ç - okay - i changed my mind. uniswap makes more sense if we are gonna get CEX traders over to DEX and they wanna get a stake of MCB

**For Both**

Petrus - Both

CoastalDegen - both, split LP incentives 50/50. between the pools. also YFI. I wouldn‚Äôt provide to uni personally - don‚Äôt feel like getting Impermanent Loss r...d.
- 0xNick - strongly disagree with splitting liquidity over Bal and Uni though. splitting liquidity across pools will make routing more expensive (gas) for aggregators like 1inch and users dipping into the platforms themselves will get greater slippage. Why split over Bal/Uni?!!?
	- Quixote - one or the other
	- CoastalDegen - this is actually a good point. We're talking a 3mil mcap illiquid shitcoin here

CHICKPEAS - why not just do both?
- CoastalDegen - both options makes most sense. to give LPs the best risk management options. 

TÃ¥ÃïuÕú“âr“âÃ¢bÕ†oÃßÕ¢ÕÄ ÕûÃ¥BÃ¢“âaÕüÕÅmbÃïÃïoÃ®o - if ppl are split on their fav, maybe it is a good idea to split 50/50 Uni/Bal for incentives

arata - Yes I say both.

AJBlock - why don‚Äôt we do 75% uniswap 25% balancer or a variation of this and then adjust the weights accordingly? Why not split between uni and bal based on the volumes of their more traded assets?

CoastalDegen - MCB/ETH on bal will attract the most farms, mcb/eth on uni would attract the most degen traders

(3.2) **Which pair? MCB/ETH MCB/?USD**

TÃ¥ÃïuÕú“âr“âÃ¢bÕ†oÃßÕ¢ÕÄ ÕûÃ¥BÃ¢“âaÕüÕÅmbÃïÃïoÃ®o - oh don't use USDC please - for anything, ever. I'd be perfectly happy with the ETH pair.

Rune20ü•Ç - MCB / ETH is best i think. ETH makes the most sense since ETH perpetual is the core product for now, so there is most synergy.

john_mc - MCB/ETH

sveer - MCB/ETH

arata - MCB/ETH

AJBlock - any pairs with stable coins atm would prevent people from eth exposure when eth is on the rise, so providing stable coin pairs would not make many people happy

CHICKPEAS - People like to collect their profits in ETH.. usdc is not much needed. MCB/ETH would be the best option. I don‚Äôt think this topic needs much of a discussion.

CoastalDegen - yeah eth over usdc imo

0xNick - MCB/ETH on Uniswap is my pref. MCB is getting a return on ETH as it is, to have an ETH/MCB pool is even better for ETH hodlers.

Quixote - it's double ETH exposure but I'm not overly fussed on this end of the day. MCB / eUSD / ETH ?? I prefer non-eth exposure in the LP.

pjwa - agree for eth pool

(3.3) **How much (percent) is allocated to MCB LPs?**

john_mc - i suggest 15%~20% of 2MCB/block

CoastalDegen - LP pools probably shouldn't get more than 30% of the mining reward
- AJBlock - 30% is a lot, I think
	- CoastalDegen - we do need to make sure it‚Äôs high enough people want to park in the pools. but agreed. maybe 20-25%.

Fab√ò - call me crazy but I would add AMPL would be the 1st one to do that and the cap is growing
- Quixote - no to ampl, please

Rune20ü•Ç - MCB LPs , can we do 0.5 - 1 per block? that way incentivize AMM liquidity miners First and then give them a path to pool MCB liquidity as well

CoastalDegen - 20% and then each uni/bal poool could get 10%

arata - 20%

Á•ûÁÅØ - It is best to allocate 15% of the mining ratio to uniswap market makers so that some mcb can be locked, and it can reduce market trading slippage and stabilize the market

Quixote - 25% to MCB stakers / LPs

(4) **Should the mining reward have a vesting period? If so, how long?**

leozing - Yes, cause we need that to deflect inflation, 3 months I would say.

CoastalDegen - what about the curve approach where it unlocks over a time period by blocktime?

AJBlock - wouldn‚Äôt adding a reward for liquidity be enough incentive to not require a vesting period?

leozing - Staking will cause people to hoard extra tokens, that would be bad for decentralization

TÃ¥ÃïuÕú“âr“âÃ¢bÕ†oÃßÕ¢ÕÄ ÕûÃ¥BÃ¢“âaÕüÕÅmbÃïÃïoÃ®o - No vesting.  Or at least very little vesting.  We're already going to incentivize pools to help price.  Why do we need vesting then?

quactity - Vesting is necessary

CoastalDegen - I think if uniswap and price discovery is the goal, vesting should be tabled. For a few weeks, we should see what uniswap + this new LP incentive does for 2-4 weeks.
- AJBlock - agreed, we can see how MCB behaves after this changes and if people are still dumping, we look into vesting

Quixote - does vesting kind of go against staking inventive?

Rune20ü•Ç - Vesting is a tough sell for a new product like MCB. Curve with their gradual vesting is probably able to get away with that because they got name recognition. I rather incentivize MCB holders to continue holding (temp solution) until we can do more with MCB (use as collateral)

CHICKPEAS - I‚Äôm definitely for vesting.. 3-4 months would make the most sense

Dalvinchi - If you introduce vesting you reduce the incentive to provide liquidity

CoastalDegen - if the goal is to grow value and reduce inflation then focus on vesting lockup and staking. If the goal is to grow adoption, liquidity, and price discovery f..k a vesting period IMO. least give 2-3 more weeks. not saying wait mad long on vesting but wait a bit. vesting and staking are both great ideas btw. I love and support 100%. Just do it in stages eh. 

0xNick - agree, let's come back to vesting after these other significant changes are made

pjwa - vesting for 4 weeks, which is a month ... likely. don‚Äôt even put 3-4 months at this stage.

john_mc - vesting should be a delay

Fab√ò - without vesting or some kind of incentive there is no incentive to hold as investors as the order book will keep being flooded by sell orders - making any price discovery almost impossible
- AJBlock - agreed, but liquidity provider rewards should address this

robino - we need vesting. CUrve has 12 months vesting for its liquidity providers. Anyone who didn‚Äôt have got their tokens rekt.
- CoastalDegen - CRV also has about 6 months of LP tokens being given out upfront. Immediately mined won‚Äôt be vested lol you shouldn‚Äôt have to control holders funds. 
- arata - yeah compared to 12 months we are starting with 3 months .thats pretty liberal. 

Quixote - yeah vesting might need more thought. it could harm liquidity. vesting is just delayed dumping. incentivise is best. 
- robino - it will not harm liquidity
	- pjwa - difficult to design this
	- robino - cause we are rewarding lP's to supply tokens

brisket - Any chance we can implement a system which a redirect non-AMM trade fees towards some sort of MCB stakers? This would give a valuation method for MCB
- AJBlock - this would really want to make people hodl, if they get part of the profits

Rune20ü•Ç - honestly, being LP in uniswap is a good stop-gap holding incentive for now. vesting isn‚Äôt necessary, at least until we revisit this topic after 4 weeks of round 2 is done.

CHICKPEAS - I think vesting is the most reasonable and logical option atm. We can‚Äôt control holders‚Äô funds. They are free to dump whenever they want. 

CoastalDegen - coins that will be mined post launch aren't vested

AJBlock - i guess that Vesting would make the people that really believe on the project to provide liquidity . . . that has its perks

leozing - Vesting + liquify providers benefits at uniswap is a very good combination> i mean vesting is good, but potentially needs more thought

CoastalDegen - im against this rash move to vesting to try and preserve your shitcoin value

Dalvinchi - Vesting here will reduce incentive to offer liquidity imo. price discovery and wallet count growth more important atm. 
- leozing - no it won‚Äôt. Because, miners will be eager to earn extra rewards by providing their stack to the uniswap pool. Not only this will help in decentralisation. It will also battle the inflation that we face.
	- Dalvinchi - I think miners care about yield... not about supporting projects. If miner has to lock incentive for 3 months they will likely just go elsewhere and earn yield on a daily basis
		- leozing - Not if they APR is high.
			- Dalvinchi - APR is tied to token value in 3 months which no one knows

pjwa - for vesting, i suggest better to discuss over some initial drafts now difficut to reach a conclusion

CHICKPEAS - Big sell pressure always keeps new investors away.. let that sink in. 3 months of vesting would be just perfect.
- Dalvinchi - why would you offer liquidity with a 3 month lock up on rewards when you can just offer somewhere else and get daily rewards???

john_mc - i support vesting ,but not in SHANG period

Rune20ü•Ç - I think we put this a governance topic on the MCDEX forum . bring this up at the next call?
- pjwa - agree as i mentioned better discuss over some proposals. we can come up with the proposal in the forum before the next meeting.

12bb))00 - yep. I support for vesting too.

(5) **Reduce imbalance penalty or completely remove it?**

Rune20ü•Ç - FYI : Referencing current imbalance penalty
![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/RhP3RB0/aaaaa.png "Imbalance Penalty")

Gareth | MCDEX - 20% will allow for less need to rebalance, and currently is expensive. I like it

Rune20ü•Ç - Agree to push to 20%.(imbalance rate threshold)

Quixote - i like 20% especially in bull market

zhiji - 20% is simple for LP.

quactity - Yes I like 20 percent

### Topic 2: eUSD

eUSD is a synthetic asset minted by tokenizing the perpetual positions.

we will discuss -
- Liquidity mining incentive on Curve?
- How much (percent) is allocated to the curve pool LPs?

First, let me update about this topic:
The smart contract is done. The audit will be done by PwC Switzerland (who acquired Chainsecurity team early on)

Reasons to choose ChainSecurity /PwC Switzerland:
- Both OpenZeppline and ConSensys Diligence are extremely busy. Their nearest available time is in September. 
- The eUSD smart contract is relatively simple, with 644 lines ( in comparison with 4215 lines for perpetual contracts). And We‚Äôve built a good relationship with ChainSecurity before. It has audited our V1.

all within the total 2/block, but this is for ZHOU round. the next after SHANG

yeah, since it's for ZHOU round, we don't need to cover too much on the incentivize part.
i want to consult the community - we will have the eUSD product live next month. Are you in with this? and whether support that we have ChainSecurity as audit team

Quixote - personally I'd suggest 25% for both MCB and eUSD. Meaning by the time its all is live, incentives are split 50/25/25 across MCB mining // eUSD adoption and MCB holding. 

john_mc - eusd is after shang period, so we can fully discuss and communicate in shang period next month

0xNick - eUSD could be a significant player in the stablecoin space. Similar to sUSD and DAI, eUSD will be trustless/permissionless. The problem these coins have is liquidity. Curve is an absolute must.
- Gareth | MCDEX - good point, though we think of eUSD more as a synthetic asset than a stable coin

john_mc - i think eUSD will bring a large number of trades  volume to the mcdex platform, Fully support the promotion of online

### Topic 3: Increase the trading fee

Increase trading fee on Order Book. Should we increase the order book trading fee to cover the gas? So right now, on order book : Taker fee :0.075%, Maker fee:  -0.025%

leozing - If done might deter adoption

john_mc - Full Support,  MCB needs empowerment

AJBlock - is it possible to integrate MCDex with another blockchain  solution to reduce transaction fees? like matic ? gas prices are crazy right now
- Gareth | MCDEX - we are looking at L2 solutions indeed

T.C. Zhu - Considering the high gas fee recently, we propose the following new fee strategy on ETH-PERP order book:

Min order size = $1000.
Maker fee rate = 0%.
Taker fee rate = 1% when order size < $10,000.
Taker fee rate = 0.15% otherwise.
According to recent order book transactions, the average gas price = 90 Gwei, the daily trade volume of order book = $1,096,070 per day. Under the new fee rate, the daily trade volume will be $1,060,180, the exchange profit will be $1,500, ROE = 0.148%.

The exchange profit can be used to buy and burn MCB in the future.

dydx has also increased fee 2 times recently. current dydx fee: min order $3000, small order(< $12000) %1
- Rune20ü•Ç - do you have stats on average trade size? Im trying to figure if 1000 min size makes sense

john_mc - <1000 size order can trade with amm

zhiji - small order size should go to trade against amm, lower slippage

T.C. Zhu - I think min order $3000 is too large. Trading fees can affect the potential value of MCB, especially if the platform has been losing money. Currently users of our platform, orders of <$1000 have almost no contribution to volume (but consume the most gas), and $1000~$10000 are the main users.

AJBlock - Yes, and gas is too expensive, it doesn't make sense to keep burning MCDex's reserves on gas difficult situations. We can have a NOTE explaining that the increase in fees is temporary due to ETH congestion, that makes people understand, everyone knows that gas is a crazy atm.
